My Code Portfolio
=================

Hello there visitor! Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio. This repo is designed to exhibit my coding abilities through various projects. Each project is designed around one feature/task in mind, to be coded in a specific language. 

Each project seeks to be self-contained and fully functional. Ideally, I would like this is to allow visitors to download a project and be able to run the application for themselves.

I'll also be maintaining a wiki page for each project, so be sure to check that out for instructions, explanations and resources.

Thank you for coming on by and if you'd like to contact me:
